Hello {{ username }},

Welcome to the DelfiTLM portal!

You are now all set to submit telemetry for the Delfi Space satellites. How?  A few easy steps:

1) Generate an API key on your account page after logging in.
2) Use our submit script template to push the data to our server.  TODO (add a link to it).

Thank you for being a part of our journey.

The Delfi Space Team
