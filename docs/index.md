# DelfiTLM

This project aims to provide a software solution for in orbit satellite operations from ground. The system is tailored around the Delfi Space satellite programme, however, the software can easily be adapted to fit any space programme that uses XTCE for data exchange. The software is built with Python Django, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Grafana, CrowdSec and Docker.

## Feature highlights

The main features currently available on the platform include:
- an authentication system
- a satellite data processing engine using the XTCE format
- support for Grafana dashboards, enabling creating and editing dashboards to analyze satellite telemetry.

The telemetry data has the potential to be sourced from a local ground station (if available), contributing radio amateurs' submissions, or from SatNOGS.

An uplink command console will also be added in the near future.
